     * passed in. There are 2 cases to consider:
     * 1: The right subtree is non-empty. In this case, the successor is the
     * leftmost node of the right subtree.
     * 2: The right subtree is empty. In this case, the successor is the lowest
     * ancestor of the node containing data whose left child is also
     * an ancestor of data.
     * 
     * The second case means the successor node will be one of the node(s) we 
     * traversed left from to find data. Since the successor is the SMALLEST element 
     * greater than data, the successor node is the lowest/last node 
     * we traversed left from on the path to the data node.

     * This should NOT be used in the remove method.

     * Ex:
     * Given the following AVL composed of Integers
     *                    76
     *                  /    \

     * successor(76) should return 81
     * successor(81) should return 90
     * successor(40) should return 76
     *
     * @param data the data to find the successor of
     * @return the successor of data. If there is no larger data than the
